** Introduction

This tag system is inspired in the [[https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tags][Stacks Project]].

Here I want to use the same pattern, namely, a string of
4 digits and capital latters, exluding the letter O. This gives
10 number + 25 letters. 

That gives 35⁴ = 1.500.625 tags. More than enough to
organize all my research until the end of my days.

Here we have the [[file:tags.org][tags]]
