        If we consider the notation _nh_, where _n_ is a number known as _replication factor_, the left
        motion is repeated _n_ times. As an example, we have the equivalence: _4h = hhhh_. The same is
        true for _j_, _k_ and _l_.
        </p>

        <p> 
        If we write _nG_, where _n_, the cursor goes to line _n_. The same is true for the other motions.
        Then, 1G is equivalent to gg.

        When we delete a character, word or line, vim saves the deleted object in a
        temporary register, so we can recover this deletion as long as we do not delete
        any other object. We have seen that we undo this deletion with the command _u_.
        It also true that we can paste the deleted object in a new place. Let us take a
        look on these commands.
