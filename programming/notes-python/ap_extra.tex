\section{Extras}

Here are notes of some extra material that I am not particularly keen to investigate now, but that might be useful in the future. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item See pep8. See Colt's section on this topic. See section 11, lesson 96.
    \item \verb|Debugging|. See section 21 of the course.
    \item Tests: \verb|Assert|, \verb|doctest| and \verb|unittest|. See section 29.
\end{itemize}
