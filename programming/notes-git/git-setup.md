# Git and Github setup

Basics on how to configure git and github. 

## Git 

Initially we can set username and email. 
```bash
git config --global user.name "NAME"
git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
```

We can check the result as 
```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

## Github

Now we need to connect our account with github with a SSH. All the setting can
be found in the links below 
* [Generate new
  keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent):
* [Adding new ssh to
  github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

  Here we basically need to copy and paste the commands there, so it does not
  make sense to reproduce the instructions here.
