** Mac Address 

MAC means *Medium Access Control*.

I can see the MAC address of my device with
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ifconfig
#+END_SRC
in the field *ether* entry. Some other options:  Also with 
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ip link show
$ nmcli device show | grep GENERAL.HWADDR
$ cat /sys/class/net/*/address # this several addresses
$ cat /sys/class/net/wlp0s20f3/address # this seems to be the most convenient
#+END_SRC

In order to check my network, I install the util `nmap`, and I scan my network
#+begin_src
$ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.15.0/24
#+end_src
and I can check the MAC addresses of devices connected to my network with:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ arp -a 
#+END_SRC
