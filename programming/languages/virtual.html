        <h1><u>Virtual Environment</u></h1>

        <p>
            The new versions of my beloved GNU/Linux have made it difficult to
            pip-install some obscure Python packages. Apparently, developers don't
            think their users are capable of making wise judgments regarding the
            usability of their systems… and they're probably right. Anyone with
            two functional neurons can see that the GNU/Linux community has some…
            anyway, I digress.
         </p>

        <p>
            The important thing now is that I need to create a virtual environment
            to carry out my inconsequential experiments... probably with Docker, but here
            I just want to do it for my Jupyter Lab calculations. 
        </p>


        <p>
            So, run the commad below to create and activate the Python virtual environment:
        </p>

            <div class="code-block">
            python -m venv my-virtual-env

            source myenv/bin/activate
            </div>

        <p>
          Now we can have some fun pip-installing all my stuff... and to make it permanent
          and reinstall it in other machine, just do:
        </p>

            <div class="code-block">
            pip freeze > requirements.txt

            pip install -r requirements.txt
            </div>

        <p>
          That's all folks!!
        </p>
